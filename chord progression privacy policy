Important Considerations:

Legal Counsel: This is a sample and may not be suitable for your specific needs. It is crucial to consult with a legal professional to draft terms of service that comply with the laws applicable to your website and business.
Privacy Policy: You will also need a separate Privacy Policy that explains how you collect, use, and share user data.
Specific Features: If your website has unique features (e.g., user accounts, saving progressions, sharing), you may need to add specific clauses related to those functionalities.
Jurisdiction: The governing law clause specifies which jurisdiction's laws will apply. Choose a jurisdiction where you operate or where your users are primarily located.
Remember to replace the bracketed placeholders with your specific information. Good luck!
