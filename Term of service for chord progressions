TERMS OF SERVICE FOR CHORD PROGRESSION AGREEMENTS
These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern agreements ("Agreements") concerning the use, licensing, or collaboration related to musical chord progressions ("Chord Progressions") between creators, licensees, and any other involved parties (collectively, "Parties"). By entering into any Agreement related to Chord Progressions, all Parties agree to be bound by these Terms.
1. Definitions
•	Chord Progression: A sequence of musical chords that creates a harmonic foundation. For the purpose of these Terms, this may include the specific sequence of chord qualities and roots, and potentially suggested voicings, but generally excludes melody, lyrics, or full musical arrangements.
•	Creator: The individual(s) or entity(ies) who originated or developed the Chord Progression.
•	Licensee: The individual(s) or entity(ies) granted rights to use the Chord Progression under an Agreement.
•	Work: Any musical composition, sound recording, or other creative work that incorporates or is derived from a Chord Progression.
•	Effective Date: The date on which an Agreement becomes legally binding.
2. Scope of Agreements
Each Agreement will specify the exact nature of the relationship between the Parties regarding a particular Chord Progression. This may include, but is not limited to:
•	Licensing: Granting a Licensee the right to use a Chord Progression for a specified purpose (e.g., in a song, film score, commercial), for a defined period, and within a certain territory, often in exchange for a fee or royalties.
•	Collaboration: Jointly creating or developing a Chord Progression, with agreed-upon ownership, revenue sharing, and creative control.
•	Work-for-Hire: Where a Chord Progression is created specifically for another party, with that party becoming the sole owner.
3. Rights and Ownership
3.1. Creator's Retained Rights: Unless explicitly transferred in an Agreement, the Creator generally retains ownership of the underlying Chord Progression. Licensing Agreements grant specific usage rights without transferring ownership.
3.2. Licensee's Rights: The specific rights granted to a Licensee will be detailed in the individual Agreement. These may include, but are not limited to: * The right to synchronize the Chord Progression with visual media. * The right to create derivative works based on the Chord Progression (e.g., adding melody, lyrics, instrumentation). * The right to publicly perform, distribute, and reproduce Works incorporating the Chord Progression.
3.3. Attribution: The Agreement will specify whether and how the Creator of the Chord Progression must be attributed in any Work.
3.4. Moral Rights: To the extent permissible by law, the Creator waives all moral rights in relation to the Chord Progression when it is incorporated into a Work, allowing for its adaptation and integration into a larger musical composition.
4. Compensation and Royalties
4.1. Payment Structure: Any compensation (e.g., one-time fee, upfront payment, royalty splits, a combination) will be clearly defined in the Agreement.
4.2. Royalty Calculation and Reporting: If royalties are involved, the Agreement will detail the royalty rate, the basis for calculation (e.g., net receipts, gross revenue), reporting frequency, and payment schedule.
4.3. Audit Rights: Licensees agree to maintain accurate records related to the use of the Chord Progression and the calculation of royalties. Creators may have the right to audit these records upon reasonable notice.
5. Warranties and Representations
5.1. Creator's Warranties: The Creator warrants that they are the sole owner of the Chord Progression or have the necessary rights to grant the licenses hereunder, and that the Chord Progression does not infringe upon any third-party copyrights or other intellectual property rights.
5.2. Licensee's Warranties: The Licensee warrants that they will use the Chord Progression only in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and these Terms, and will not use it in any illegal, defamatory, or infringing manner.
6. Indemnification
Each Party agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the other Party from and against any and all claims, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from a breach of their warranties, representations, or obligations under these Terms or any Agreement.
7. Term and Termination
7.1. Term: The term of each Agreement will be specified within that Agreement.
7.2. Termination for Cause: Either Party may terminate an Agreement if the other Party materially breaches any of its obligations hereunder and fails to cure such breach within a specified period (e.g., 30 days) after receiving written notice.
7.3. Effect of Termination: Upon termination, all rights granted to the Licensee under the Agreement will revert to the Creator, and the Licensee must cease all use of the Chord Progression, except for any perpetual rights explicitly granted in the Agreement. Obligations related to royalty payments for past usage will survive termination.
8. Confidentiality
All Parties agree to keep confidential any proprietary or sensitive information disclosed during the course of entering into or performing under an Agreement.
9. Dispute Resolution
9.1. Negotiation: In the event of a dispute, the Parties agree to first attempt to resolve the matter through good-faith negotiation.

The Parties agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in [Insert Jurisdiction, e.g., Singapore] for any disputes arising hereunder.
10. General Provisions
10.1. Entire Agreement: These Terms, together with any specific Agreement, constitute the entire understanding between the Parties concerning the Chord Progression and supersede all prior and contemporaneous agreements, whether written or oral.
10.2. Amendments: Any amendments or modifications to these Terms or an Agreement must be in writing and signed by all Parties.
10.3. Severability: If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable, THE REMAINING PROVISIONS SHALL REMAIN IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT.

BY ENTERING INTO AN AGREEMENT RELATED TO A CHORD PROGRESSION, ALL PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD, AND AGREED TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF SERVICE.

IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS AND DISCLAIMER:
•	LEGAL ADVICE IS CRUCIAL: THIS SAMPLE IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE LEGAL ADVICE. CHORD PROGRESSIONS CAN BE COMPLEX IN TERMS OF COPYRIGHTABILITY, ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE COMMONALITY OF CERTAIN SEQUENCES. A LAWYER SPECIALIZING IN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND ENTERTAINMENT LAW SHOULD BE CONSULTED TO DRAFT OR REVIEW ANY ACTUAL AGREEMENT.
•	JURISDICTION: LAWS VARY SIGNIFICANTLY BY COUNTRY AND REGION. THE "GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION" SECTION IS CRITICAL AND MUST BE TAILORED TO THE SPECIFIC CONTEXT.
•	SPECIFICS OF THE CHORD PROGRESSION: THE MORE UNIQUE AND DEVELOPED A CHORD PROGRESSION, THE STRONGER ITS POTENTIAL FOR COPYRIGHT PROTECTION. AGREEMENTS SHOULD IDEALLY REFERENCE A SPECIFIC, IDENTIFIABLE PROGRESSION (E.G., BY MUSICAL NOTATION OR AUDIO FILE).
•	CLARITY IS KEY: AMBIGUITY CAN LEAD TO DISPUTES. ENSURE ALL TERMS, ESPECIALLY REGARDING RIGHTS, COMPENSATION, AND TERMINATION, ARE CRYSTAL CLEAR IN THE INDIVIDUAL AGREEMENT.
•	REGISTRATION: CONSIDER WHETHER REGISTERING THE UNDERLYING MUSICAL WORK (IF APPLICABLE) THAT CONTAINS THE CHORD PROGRESSION IS BENEFICIAL FOR PROTECTION.
